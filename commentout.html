       <h3>charset Rule</h3>
    <p>charset rule must be written right at the beginning of the style sheet without even a space before it. The value is held in quotes and should be one of the standard character-sets</p>
    <h3>font-face Rule</h3>
    <p>font-face is extremely complicated, and its use is not recommended for any except those who are expert in font metrics</p>
